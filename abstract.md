Causal Mediation Analysis
(_1497/1500 characters, excluding title_)

Causal mediation analysis can provide a mechanistic understanding of how 
an exposure impacts an outcome, a central goal in epidemiology and health 
and social sciences. However, rapid methodologic developments coupled 
with few formal courses presents challenges to implementation. Beginning 
with an overview of classical direct and indirect effects, this workshop 
will present recent advances that overcome limitations of previous methods, 
allowing for: (i) continuous exposures, (ii) multiple, non-independent 
mediators, and (iii) effects identifiable in the presence of intermediate 
confounders affected by exposure. Emphasis will be placed on flexible, 
stochastic and interventional direct and indirect effects, highlighting 
how these may be applied to answer substantive epidemiological questions 
from real-world studies. Multiply robust, nonparametric estimators of 
these causal effects, and free and open source `R` packages (`medshift` 
and `medoutcon`) for their application, will be introduced.

To ensure translation to real-world data analysis, this workshop will 
incorporate hands-on `R` programming exercises to allow participants 
practice in implementing the statistical tools presented. It is recommended 
that participants have working knowledge of the basic notions of causal 
inference, including counterfactuals and identification (linking the causal 
effect to a parameter estimable from the observed data distribution). 
Familiarity with the `R` programming language is also recommended.
